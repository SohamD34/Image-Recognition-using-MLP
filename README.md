# Image-Recognition

- Created a MLP model using Sequential to predict image classes on MNIST dataset

- Used a 2 layer perceptron with varying activation functions 
- 1. ReLU and Sigmoid
- 2. ReLU and Tanh
- 3. Sigmoid and Tanh
  
- Comparative study of the results obtained for the different cases
